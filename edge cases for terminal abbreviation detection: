edge cases for terminal abbreviation detection:

M.M. lskdjflsdfl  - detect . then cap then . then concat

A. klsdflsk       - detect . then cap then if nothing then concat

Bl. laskjfdlsfj   - V

			cant detect . then cap
			cant detect . then until cap / first cap -- ... USSR. I ....
											... U.S.S.R. I ...
												will also mess up the first one
						have to do some word structural analysis on the previous word (i.e, last name) but this is not language agnostic not does it work for irregular names
			may be able to detect if the next work is even a word




I go to UTD. A.K. Chaikovsky goes here too.
